# Starlove

## Educational Hackathon from Wild Code School

### Introduction

This is a small project for a Hackathon organized in the halfway point of the 5-month Java training course from the Wild Code School.

#### Instructions

A database of characters and planets from the Star Wars universe is given.
The goal is to create a web application which handles this database. 

The topic was free. We chose to make a love application to find a fictional partner from the Star Wars Universe according to specific criteria.

#### Constraints

- **Time constraint**: 2 days
- **Languages and frameworks**: Java and Spring JDBC
- **Support**: for mobiles only (not for desktops)
- **Database**: the given Star Wars database has to be used

### Presentation of the app

#### User stories - Features summary

Three main features were developped:
- **random research**: a user can find a random partner from the Star Wars Universe, whatever its gender, species or planet.
- **research by place**: a user can find a random partner based on a specific planet, whatever its sex or species. 
- **research by advanced criteria**: a user can find a random partner responding to four specific criteria: the planet, the gender, the eyes colour and the hair colour.
